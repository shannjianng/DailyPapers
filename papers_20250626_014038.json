    "abstract": "Objective.Brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging plays crucial roles in research and diagnosis of various brain diseases. To achieve high spatial resolution and high sensitivity, we proposed a hemispherical geometry which offers higher sensitivity with fewer detectors than a conventional cylindrical geometry. Our developed hemispherical brain PET system, Vrain, has indeed achieved a rod resolution of 2.2 mm with a 229 ps time-of-flight (TOF) resolution. To further improve the spatial resolution, we will use TOF and depth-of-interaction (DOI) detectors with our original crosshair light-sharing (CLS) configuration. This study aimed at estimating the performance of the hemispherical brain PET with TOF-DOI detectors and at developing a one-ring PET prototype with 1.6 mm scintillator pitch CLS-based TOF-DOI detectors.Approach.The sensitivity, rod resolution, and image quality of the TOF-DOI hemispherical brain PET (TDHBP-sim) and Vrain (Vrain-sim) were estimated using Geant4 simulation. A one-ring prototype with a 30 cm diameter was developed using the CLS-based TOF-DOI detectors. The energy resolution, TOF timing resolution, rod resolution, and the Hoffman brain phantom image quality of the prototype were evaluated.Main results.In the simulation study, TDHBP-sim achieved 1.4 times better sensitivity than Vrain-sim. TDHBP-sim visualized 1.0 mm rods and gyri and sulci structures in the brain phantom. In the one-ring experiment, the energy resolution was 11.6% at 511 keV, the TOF timing resolution was 294.6 ps, and 1.0 mm rods were resolved at the central 10 cm-diameter field-of-view. The 0.8 mm-thick radioactivity distribution could be identified in the Hoffman phantom.Significance.The study findings suggested that a hemispherical brain PET with 1.6 mm scintillator pitch TOF-DOI detectors should offer excellent performance including 1 mm rod resolution.",

A conditional generative adversarial network (pix2pix) was trained on progressively noisier data, where detector resolution effects were introduced gradually to simulate realistic conditions. FN data were generated using Monte Carlo simulations of an 85 MeV proton pencil beam in a computed tomography-based lung cancer patient model, with range shifts emulating weight gain and loss. The network was trained to estimate the expected two-dimensional ground truth FN production distribution from simple back-projection images. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error, structural similarity index (SSIM), and the correlation between shifts in predicted distributions and true range shifts.Main results. Our results show that pix2pix performs well on noise-free data but suffers from significant degradation when detector resolution effects are introduced. Among the LM-MAP-EM approaches tested, incorporating a mean prior estimate into the reconstruction process improved performance, with LM-MAP-EM using a mean prior estimate outperforming naïve LM maximum likelihood EM (LM-MLEM) and conventional LM-MAP-EM with a smoothing quadratic energy function in terms of SSIM.Significance.

However, the temporal resolution of small animal PET imaging has been limited to a scale of seconds due to low sensitivity, and it is not sufficient to capture cardiac or brain function accurately. Here, we present an ultrasensitive small-animal PET scanner with total-body coverage for sub-second dynamic imaging of a rat.Methods.The ultrasensitive small animal PET scanner has a 155 mm inner diameter and 325.6 mm axial coverage. The PET scanner has six rings, each of which has 10 depth-of-interaction (DOI) detectors. Each DOI detector consists of a four-layer Zr-doped gadolinium oxyorthosilicate crystal array (2.85 mm pitch, 30 mm total thickness) and 8 × 8 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) enables the quantification of physiological parameters of radiotracers employed in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously introduced a factor analysis-based algorithm, Cluster-Initialized Factor Analysis (CIFA), designed to overcome the problem of specifying reference regions. CIFA is capable of automatically extracting distinct radiotracer binding distributions across many modalities based on the differences in tracer dynamics, and thus can distinguish regions of specific- and non-specific binding without requiring prior segmentation.\nPURPOSE: Our goal is to quantitatively validate the ability of CIFA to resolve different dynamic biological processes by comparing the output of the algorithm to an independent benchmark. As an intermediate goal, we aim to create a physical phantom capable of modeling unique aspects of dynamic imaging and to use this phantom as the benchmark in evaluating CIFA.\nMETHODS: CIFA was used to reconstruct 18F-flortaucipir dynamic brain PET datasets acquired at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. The resulting factor curves served as the foundation for creating dynamic input time-activity curve (TAC) combinations in a physical brain phantom specifically constructed for this purpose. The phantom represented three components: two overlapping tissue types and free radiotracer, constructed with a combination of small hydraulic elements. The physical components were scanned separately to generate a library of images, allowing us to reproduce scans of any duration with prescribed dynamics and realistic partial volume effects. The phantom was designed to produce noisy instances with compartment mixing of dynamic scans with desired activity TACs for free, non-specifically bound, and specifically bound radiotracers. Ten distinct dynamic simulations with varying levels of TAC similarity were estimated with CIFA.\nRESULTS: We directly evaluated CIFA's performance in analyzing each of the 10 dynamic datasets by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient between the estimated outputs and the ground truth tissue TACs and corresponding tissue distributions. For seven out of 10 modeled dynamics, which captured the full spectrum of realistically expected tissue TAC shapes, the curve correlation of the specific binding tissue was above 95%.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work formulated an innovative process by combining a physical phantom design with PET images for evaluating the application of CIFA in the extraction of dynamic TACs from dynamic PET image data. In most cases the CIFA algorithm accurately reproduced the dynamics of the phantom simulated data.",

Currently, there is a lack of effective tools to investigate the entire PG imaging process in patient anatomy, from PG emission to camera detection and image reconstruction, to evaluate and optimize its efficacy for dose verification in proton therapy.Approach. To address this gap, we developed a Monte-Carlo package, POLARIS J Monte Carlo (PJ-MC), that simulates the entire PG emission and imaging workflow in patient anatomy. We utilized Geant4 classes and G4-ancillary tools, employing the DCMTK external tool with G4PhantomParameterisation to convert patient CT data into voxelized geometries. Proton beams were modeled based on medical physics commissioning data. A novel two-stage POLARIS-J3 Compton-Camera was simulated under the patient couch for recording total, double, and triple scattered PG signals. Proton maximum range calculations from the PJ-MC are compared with dose calculations from a clinical treatment planning system. The detected PG signals data in the simulation were used to reconstruct PG images using Kernel- Weighted-Back-Projection algorithm.Main results. Analysis of gamma energy distribution showed a decay pattern with clear emission lines from nuclear reactions involving oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and calcium. Neutron-induced reactions contribute significantly less-by an order of magnitude-compared to proton-induced reactions in various tissues. Mean absolute percentage error analysis showed that PG range verification was more stable when considering the range at 80%or 50%ofDmax, as opposed to the range at theDmax, where energy gating slightly improves accuracy but may reduce localization due to photon loss. Results showed that patient anatomy can impact the location of hot spot in the PG images, affecting its accuracy for localizing Bragg peak.Significance. In summary, our simulation package provides additional insights into PG emission and imaging in patient anatomy and serves as a robust tool for evaluating and optimizing PG imaging, enhancing its precision for dose verification in proton therapy.",

    "abstract": "Objective.Deep learning models are increasingly being implemented for automated medical image analysis to inform patient care. Most models, however, lack uncertainty information, without which the reliability of model outputs cannot be ensured. Several uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods exist to capture model uncertainty. Yet, it is not clear which method is optimal for a given task. The purpose of this work was to investigate several commonly used UQ methods for the critical yet understudied task of metastatic lesion segmentation on whole body PET/CT.Approach.59 whole body68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT images of patients undergoing theranostic treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were used in this work. A 3D U-Net was trained for lesion segmentation following five-fold cross validation. Uncertainty measures derived from four UQ methods-probability entropy, Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, and test time augmentation-were investigated. Each uncertainty measure was assessed across four quantitative evaluations: (1) its ability to detect artificially degraded image data at low, medium, and high degradation magnitudes; (2) to detect false-positive (FP) predicted regions; (3) to recover false-negative (FN) predicted regions; and (4) to establish correlations with model biomarker extraction and segmentation performance metrics.Mainresults.Test time augmentation and probability entropy respectively achieved the highest and lowest degraded image detection at low (AUC = 0.54 vs. 0.68), medium (AUC = 0.70 vs. 0.82), and high (AUC = 0.83 vs. 0.90) degradation magnitudes. For detecting FPs, all UQ methods achieve strong performance, with AUC values ranging narrowly between 0.77 and 0.81. FN region recovery performance was strongest for test time augmentation and weakest for probability entropy. Performance for the correlation analysis was mixed, where the strongest performance was achieved by test time augmentation for SUVtotalcapture (ρ= 0.57) and segmentation Dice coefficient (ρ= 0.72), by Monte Carlo dropout for SUVmeancapture (ρ= 0.35), and by probability entropy for segmentation cross entropy (ρ= 0.96).Significance.Overall, test time augmentation demonstrated superior UQ performance and is recommended for use in metastatic lesion segmentation task.

    "abstract": "Background. Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) is a multi-modality medical imaging technique widely used for screening and diagnosis of lesions and tumors, in which, CT can provide detailed anatomical structures, while PET can show metabolic activities. Nevertheless, it has disadvantages such as long scanning time, high cost, and relatively high radiation doses.Purpose. We propose a deep learning model for the whole-body CT-to-PET synthesis task, generating high-quality synthetic PET images that are comparable to real ones in both clinical relevance and diagnostic value.Material. We collect 102 pairs of 3D CT and PET scans, which are sliced into 27 240 pairs of 2D CT and PET images (training: 21,855 pairs, validation: 2810 pairs, testing: 2575 pairs).Methods. We propose a transformer-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN) for whole-body CT-to-PET synthesis task. The CPGAN model uses residual blocks and fully connected transformer residual blocks to capture both local features and global contextual information. A customized loss function incorporating structural consistency is designed to improve the quality of synthesized PET images.Results. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate effectiveness of the CPGAN model. The mean and standard variance of NRMSE, PSNR and SSIM values on test set are(16.90±12.27)×10-4,28.71±2.67and0.926±0.033, respectively, outperforming other seven state-of-the-art models. Three radiologists independently and blindly evaluated and gave subjective scores to 100 randomly chosen PET images (50 real and 50 synthetic). By Wilcoxon signed rank test, there are no statistical differences between the synthetic PET images and the real ones.Conclusions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac perfusion PET is commonly used to assess ischemia and cardiovascular risk, which enables quantitative measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) through kinetic modeling. However, the estimation of kinetic parameters is challenging due to the noisy nature of short dynamic frames and limited sample data points.\nPURPOSE: This work aimed to investigate the errors in MBF estimation in PET through a simulation study and to evaluate different parameter estimation approaches, including a deep learning (DL) method.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulated studies were generated using digital phantoms based on cardiac segmentations from 55 clinical CT images. We employed the irreversible 2-tissue compartmental model and simulated dynamic 13N-ammonia PET scans under both rest and stress conditions (220 cases each). The simulations covered a rest K1 range of 0.6 to 1.2 and a stress K1 range of 1.2 to 3.6 (unit: mL/min/g) in the myocardium. A transformer-based DL model was trained on the simulated dataset to predict parametric images (PIMs) from noisy PET image frames and was validated using 5-fold cross-validation. We compared the DL method with the voxel-wise nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting applied to the dynamic images, using either Gaussian filter (GF) smoothing (GF-NLS) or a dynamic nonlocal means (DNLM) algorithm for denoising (DNLM-NLS). Two patients with coronary CT angiography (CTA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were enrolled to test the feasibility of applying DL models on clinical PET data.\nRESULTS: The DL method showed clearer image structures with reduced noise compared to the traditional NLS-based methods. In terms of mean absolute relative error (MARE), as the rest K1 values increased from 0.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the overall bias in myocardium K1 estimates decreased from approximately 58% to 45% for the NLS-based methods while the DL method showed a reduction in MARE from 42% to 18%. For stress data, as the stress K1 decreased from 3.6 to 1.2 mL/min/g, the MARE increased from 30% to 70% for the GF-NLS method. In contrast, both the DNLM-NLS (average: 42%) and the DL methods (average: 20%) demonstrated significantly smaller MARE changes as stress K1 varied. Regarding the regional mean bias (±standard deviation), the GF-NLS method had a bias of 6.30% (±8.35%) of rest K1, compared to 1.10% (±8.21%) for DNLM-NLS and 6.28% (±14.05%) for the DL method. For the stress K1, the GF-NLS showed a mean bias of 10.72% (±9.34%) compared to 1.69% (±8.82%) for DNLM-NLS and -10.55% (±9.81%) for the DL method.\nSIGNIFICANCE: This study showed that an increase in the tracer uptake rate (K1) corresponded to improved accuracy and precision in MBF quantification, whereas lower tracer uptake resulted in higher noise in dynamic PET and poorer parameter estimates. Utilizing denoising techniques or DL approaches can mitigate noise-induced bias in PET parametric imaging.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Positron emission tomography (PET) is affected by statistical noise due to constraints on tracer dose and scan duration, impacting both diagnostic performance and quantitative accuracy. While deep learning-based PET denoising methods have been used to improve image quality, they may introduce over-smoothing, which can obscure critical structural details and compromise quantitative accuracy. We propose a method for making a deep learning solution more reliable and apply it to the conditional deep image prior (DIP).Approach. We introduce the idea ofstability informationin the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling the identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization trajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from multiple intermediate outputs of a moderate neural network at different optimization steps. The final denoised PET image is then obtained by computing a linear combination of the DIP output and the original reconstructed PET image, weighted by the stability map.Main results. We employed eight high-resolution brain PET datasets for comparison. Our method effectively reduces background noise while preserving small structure details in brain [18F]FDG PET images. Comparative analysis demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing methods in terms of peak-to-valley ratio and background noise suppression across various low-dose levels. Additionally, region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the proposed method maintains quantitative accuracy without introducing under- or over-estimation. Furthermore, we applied our method to full-dose PET data to assess its impact on image quality. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced background noise while preserving the peak-to-valley ratio at a level comparable to that of unfiltered full-dose PET images.Significance. The proposed method introduces a robust approach to deep learning-based PET denoising, enhancing its reliability and preserving quantitative accuracy.

    "abstract": "Objective.Secondary electron bremsstrahlung (SEB) imaging, along with prompt gamma (PG) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, has been proposed as anin vivorange verification tool for proton therapy. This study presents the first simulation based on patient computed tomography (CT) data to investigate the feasibility of SEB imaging for range verification in proton therapy, while comparing the characteristics of SEB imaging with those of PG and PET imaging.Approach.A Monte Carlo simulation was performed using patient CT data for the irradiation of monoenergetic pencil beams and spread-out Bragg peak proton beams. The physical characteristics of SEB imaging were analyzed at three different anatomical sites and compared with those of PG and PET imaging.Main results. In all the treatment cases, SEB imaging exhibited higher production rates than PG and PET imaging, particularly in the regions with high CT values along the beam path. Although the SEB signal was more affected by scattering and absorption than the PET or PG signals, sufficient statistical counts for range verification (∼3 × 10-3SEBs/proton) could potentially be detected outside the patient geometry. For pencil beam cases, the SEB and PET fall-offs were located 4-5 mm proximal to the dose fall-off, while the PG fall-off was located 0-1 mm distal to it.Significance.Results suggest that SEB imaging has the potential to offer a real-time range verification tool (by comparing measured and expected images), particularly for treating shallow-seated tumors using proton pencil-beam scanning delivery. Thus, this study represents a significant step towards the clinical application of range verification based on SEB imaging and promotes future efforts in this direction.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) holds promise for improving outcomes in head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients by enhancing organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. A key challenge in IMPT is ensuring an accurate dose delivery at the distal edge of the tumor, where the steep dose gradients make treatment precision highly sensitive to uncertainties in both proton range and patient setup. Thus, IMPT conformality is increased by incorporating robust margins in the treatment optimization. However, an increment in the plan robustness could lead to an OAR overdosing. Therefore, an accurate distal edge verification during dose delivery is crucial to increase IMPT conformality by reducing optimization settings in treatment planning.\nPURPOSE: This work aims to evaluate, in a quasi-clinical setting, a novel approach for accurate instantaneous proton beam distal edge verification in IMPT by means of spot-by-spot positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\nMETHODS: An anthropomorphic head and neck phantom CIRS-731 HN was irradiated at the head and neck region. The targets were defined as 4 cm diameter spheres. A 60-ms delay was introduced between the proton beam spots in order to enable the spot-by-spot coincidence detection of the 511-keV photons resulting from positron annihilation following the positron emission from very short-lived positron-emitting, mainly 12N (T1/2  = 11.0 ms). Additionally, modified irradiations were carried out using solid water slabs of 2 and 5 mm thickness in the beam path to assess the precision of the approach for detecting range deviations. The positron activity range (PAR) was determined from the 50% distal fall-off position of the 1D longitudinal positron activity profile derived from the 2D image reconstructions. Furthermore, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed using an in-house RayStation/GATE MC framework to predict the positron activity images and verify the PAR measurements.\nRESULTS: PAR measurements achieved a precision between 1.5 and 3.6 mm (at 1.5σ clinical level) at the beam spot level within sub-second time scales. Measured PAR shifts of 1.6-2.1  and 4.2--.7 mm were observed with the 2- and 5-mm thickness range shifters, respectively, aligning with the corresponding proton dose range (PDR) shifts of 1.3-1.8 and 3.9-4.3 mm. The simulated PAR agrees with the measured PARs, showing an average range difference of ∼0.4 mm.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the feasibility of instantaneous distal edge verification using PET imaging by introducing beam spot delays during dose delivery. The findings represent a first step toward the clinical implementation of instantaneous in vivo distal edge verification. The approach contributes to the development of real-time range verification aimed at improving IMPT treatments by mitigating range and setup uncertainties, thereby reducing dose to organs-at-risk and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) is essential in the radiotherapy treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. However, this process is subject to inter-reader variability due to the need for clinical assessment of risk and extent of potential microscopic spread. This can lead to inconsistencies in treatment planning, potentially impacting treatment outcomes. Most existing automatic CTV delineation methods do not account for this variability and can only generate a single CTV for each case.\nPURPOSE: This study aims to develop a deep learning-based technique to generate multiple CTV contours for each case, simulating the inter-reader variability in the clinical practice.\nMETHODS: We employed a publicly available dataset consisting of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), x-ray computed tomography (CT), and pre-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 51 patients with soft tissue sarcoma, along with an independent validation set containing five additional patients. An experienced reader drew a contour of the gross tumor volume (GTV) for each patient based on multi-modality images. Subsequently, two additional readers, together with the first one, were responsible for contouring three CTVs in total based on the GTV. We developed a diffusion model-based deep learning method that is capable of generating arbitrary number of different and plausible CTVs to mimic the inter-reader variability in CTV delineation. The proposed model incorporates a separate encoder to extract features from the GTV masks, leveraging the critical role of GTV information in accurate CTV delineation.\nRESULTS: The proposed diffusion model demonstrated superior performance with the highest Dice Index (0.902 compared to values below 0.881 for state-of-the-art models) and the best generalized energy distance (GED) (0.209 compared to values exceeding 0.221 for state-of-the-art models). It also achieved the second-highest recall and precision metrics among the compared ambiguous image segmentation models. Results from both datasets exhibited consistent trends, reinforcing the reliability of our findings. Additionally, ablation studies exploring different model structures and input configurations highlighted the significance of incorporating prior GTV information for accurate CTV delineation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed diffusion model successfully generates multiple plausible CTV contours for soft tissue sarcomas, effectively capturing inter-reader variability in CTV delineation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically receive surgery as their primary form of treatment. However, studies have shown that a high proportion of these patients will experience a recurrence after their resection, leading to an increased risk of death. Cancer staging is currently the gold standard for establishing a patient's prognosis and can help clinicians determine patients who may benefit from additional therapy. However, medical images which are used to help determine the cancer stage, have been shown to hold unutilized prognostic information that can augment clinical data and better identify high-risk NSCLC patients. There remains an unmet need for models to incorporate clinical, pathological, surgical, and imaging information, and extend beyond the current staging system to assist clinicians in identifying patients who could benefit from additional therapy immediately after surgery.\nPURPOSE: We aimed to determine whether a deep learning model (DLM) integrating FDG PET and CT imaging from the thoracic cavity along with clinical, surgical, and pathological information can predict NSCLC recurrence-free survival (RFS) and stratify patients into risk groups better than conventional staging.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgically resected NSCLC patients enrolled between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed from two academic institutions (local institution: 305 patients; external validation: 195 patients). The thoracic cavity (including the lungs, mediastinum, pleural interfaces, and thoracic vertebrae) was delineated on the preoperative FDG PET and CT images and combined with each patient's clinical, surgical, and pathological information. Using the local cohort of patients, a multi-modal DLM using these features was built in a training cohort (n = 225), tuned on a validation cohort (n = 45), and evaluated on testing (n = 35) and external validation (n = 195) cohorts to predict RFS and stratify patients into risk groups. The area under the curve (AUC), Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank test were used to assess the prognostic value of the model. The DLM's stratification performance was compared to the conventional staging stratification.\nRESULTS: The multi-modal DLM incorporating imaging, pathological, surgical, and clinical data predicted RFS in the testing cohort (AUC = 0.78 [95% CI:0.63-0.94]) and external validation cohort (AUC = 0.66 [95% CI:0.58-0.73]). The DLM significantly stratified patients into high, medium, and low-risk groups of RFS in both the testing and external validation cohorts (multivariable log-rank p < 0.001) and outperformed conventional staging. Conventional staging was unable to stratify patients into three distinct risk groups of RFS (testing: p = 0.94; external validation: p = 0.38). Lastly, the DLM displayed the ability to further stratify patients significantly into sub-risk groups within each stage in the testing (stage I: p = 0.02, stage II: p = 0.03) and external validation (stage I: p = 0.05, stage II: p = 0.03) cohorts.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to use multi-modality imaging along with clinical, surgical, and pathological data to predict RFS of NSCLC patients after surgery. The multi-modal DLM better stratified patients into risk groups of poor outcomes when compared to conventional staging and further stratified patients within each staging classification. This model has the potential to assist clinicians in better identifying patients that may benefit from additional therapy.",

Normalized ratio of ungated and RRA PET relative to the ground-truth static PET was calculated for RSUVmax, RSUVmean, RSUVpeak, RVolume, and relative contrast-to-noise ratio (RCNR). Additionally, 30 lung cancer patients with 76 lung lesions less than 3 cm in diameter were prospectively studied. The overall image quality of patient examination was scored using a 5-point scale by two radiologists. SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, volume, and CNR of lesions measured in ungated and RRA PET were compared, and subgroup analysis was conducted.\nRESULTS: In RRA PET images, motion artifacts of the spheres in the phantom were effectively mitigated, regardless of changes in movement amplitudes or duration. For all spheres with different ranges of motion and cycles, RSUVmax, RSUVmean, RSUVpeak, and RCNR increased significantly (p ≤ 0.001) and RVolume decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in RRA PET images. The average radiologist scores of image quality were 3.90 ± 0.86 with RRA PET, and 3.03 ± 1.19 with ungated PET.

The aim of this study was to preliminarily assess the role of the A2C algorithm in estimating the kinetic parameters of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with HCC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 18F-FDG PET data from 14 liver tissues and 17 HCC tumors obtained via a previously developed, abbreviated acquisition protocol (5-min dynamic PET/CT imaging supplemented with 1-min static imaging at 60 min) were prospectively collected. The A2C algorithm was used to estimate kinetic parameters with a reversible double-input, three-compartment model, and the results were compared with those of the conventional nonlinear least squares (NLLS) algorithm. Fitting errors were compared via the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the time activity curves (TACs).\nRESULTS: Significant differences in K1, k2, k3, k4, fa, and vb according to the A2C algorithm and k3, fa, and vb according to the NLLS algorithm were detected between HCC and normal liver tissues (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, A2C demonstrated superior diagnostic performance over NLLS in terms of k3 and vb (both p < 0.05 in the Delong test).

    "abstract": "Objective. Pixelated detectors with single-ended readout are routinely used by commercial positron emission tomography scanners owing to their good energy and timing resolution and optimized manufacturing, but they typically do not provide depth-of-interaction (DOI) information, which can help improve the performance of systems with higher resolution and smaller ring diameter. This work aims to develop a technique for multi-level DOI classification that does not require modifications to the detector designs.Approach. We leveraged high-speed (5 Gs s-1) waveform sampling electronics with the Domino Ring Sampler (DRS4) and machine learning (ML) methods to extract DOI information from the entire scintillation waveforms of pixelated crystals. We evaluated different grouping schemes for multi-level DOI classification by analyzing the DOI positioning profile and DOI positioning error. We examined trade-offs among crystal configurations, detector timing performance, and DOI classification accuracy. We also investigated the impact of different ML algorithms and input features-extracted from scintillation waveforms-on model accuracy.Main results. The DOI positioning profile and positioning error suggest that 2- or 3-level binning was effective for 20 mm long crystals. 2-level discrete DOI models achieved 95% class-wise accuracy and 83% overall accuracy in positioning events into the correct DOI level and 3-level up to 90% class-wise accuracy for long and narrow crystals (2 × 2 × 20 mm3). Long short-term memory networks trained with time-frequency moments were twice as efficient in training time while maintaining equal or better accuracy compared to those trained with waveforms. Classical ML algorithms exhibit comparable accuracy while consuming one order less training time than deep learning models.Significance. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept approach for obtaining DOI information from commercially available pixelated detectors without altering the detector design thereby avoiding potential degradation in detector timing performance.
