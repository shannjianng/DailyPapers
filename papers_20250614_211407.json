    "abstract": "Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) enables the quantification of physiological parameters of radiotracers employed in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously introduced a factor analysis-based algorithm, Cluster-Initialized Factor Analysis (CIFA), designed to overcome the problem of specifying reference regions. CIFA is capable of automatically extracting distinct radiotracer binding distributions across many modalities based on the differences in tracer dynamics, and thus can distinguish regions of specific- and non-specific binding without requiring prior segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) holds promise for improving outcomes in head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients by enhancing organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. A key challenge in IMPT is ensuring an accurate dose delivery at the distal edge of the tumor, where the steep dose gradients make treatment precision highly sensitive to uncertainties in both proton range and patient setup. Thus, IMPT conformality is increased by incorporating robust margins in the treatment optimization. However, an increment in the plan robustness could lead to an OAR overdosing. Therefore, an accurate distal edge verification during dose delivery is crucial to increase IMPT conformality by reducing optimization settings in treatment planning.",

However, this process is subject to inter-reader variability due to the need for clinical assessment of risk and extent of potential microscopic spread.

Most existing automatic CTV delineation methods do not account for this variability and can only generate a single CTV for each case.",

However, studies have shown that a high proportion of these patients will experience a recurrence after their resection, leading to an increased risk of death. Cancer staging is currently the gold standard for establishing a patient's prognosis and can help clinicians determine patients who may benefit from additional therapy. However, medical images which are used to help determine the cancer stage, have been shown to hold unutilized prognostic information that can augment clinical data and better identify high-risk NSCLC patients. There remains an unmet need for models to incorporate clinical, pathological, surgical, and imaging information, and extend beyond the current staging system to assist clinicians in identifying patients who could benefit from additional therapy immediately after surgery.",
